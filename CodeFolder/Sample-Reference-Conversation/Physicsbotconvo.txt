Dynamics Of Rotational Motion About A Fixed Axis - BYJU'S
In rotational motion, the concept of the work-energy principle is based on torque. It is stated as the object is said to be in a balanced state if its displacements and rotations are equal to zero when a force is applied. Consider a rigid body such that Œîùõ≥ is the small rotation experienced by the object.

Rotational Motion in Physics class 11 - Physics Wallah
Rotational Motion of Class 11. In the previous chapters we have studied the translatory motion. In this chapter we will study the rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed axis. A rigid body is defined as an object that has fixed size and shape. In other words, the relative positions of its constituent particles remain constant.

The kinematics of rotational motion describes the relationships between the angle of rotation, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and time. It only describes motion‚Äîit does not include any forces or masses that may affect rotation (these are part of dynamics).

I am facing difficulty in kinematics
18:06
sefbot
I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with kinematics. Let's see how we can make this topic easier for you!

Kinematics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects without considering its causes. Here are the fundamental concepts you need to understand:

1. Displacement: This is the change in position of an object. It's a vector quantity ‚Äì which means it has both magnitude (how much the position changed) and direction (where the object moved).

2. Velocity: Velocity is the rate of change of displacement. In other words, how quickly an object changes its position. Again, it's a vector.

3. Speed: This is similar to velocity but it's a scalar quantity, so it only has magnitude. That is, there's no direction involved ‚Äì it's just the magnitude of how quickly an object is moving.

4. Acceleration: Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. In simpler terms, it‚Äôs how fast the speed of an object is changing over time.

These are foundationally essential for equations of motion, often referred to as "kinematic equations", which are used to solve problems.

Let's start with the first concept. Could you let me know where specifically within the topic of kinematics you're experiencing difficulty? Maybe we can break it down and tackle the issues one by one.

i am weak in projectile motion
18:07
sefbot
I see. Projectile motion can be a tricky concept at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes much simpler. Here's a brief overview to start:

Projectile motion is a form of motion experienced by an object or particle (a projectile) that is thrown near the earth's surface and moves along a curved path under the action of gravity only (assuming air resistance is negligible).

This type of motion is broken down into two components:
1. Horizontal motion
2. Vertical motion

Each of these components can be treated independently of the other.

1. Horizontal motion: Even though gravity is acting on the projectile, it doesn't affect the horizontal motion. That's because gravity acts vertically. Therefore, the horizontal velocity of the projectile remains constant.

2. Vertical motion: This is influenced by gravity which pulls the object downwards. Therefore, the vertical velocity of the projectile changes, and it does so at a constant rate. This acceleration is equal to g (acceleration due to gravity).

Here are the three main characteristics of projectile motion:

1. The path followed by a projectile motion is a parabola.
2. The horizontal motion happens at a constant velocity. This means the object in motion would continue to move at the same speed in the horizontal direction if the Earth were perfectly flat.
3. The vertical motion is uniformly accelerated motion, i.e., motion under a constant gravitational force.

An important point to note is that the maximum height reached by the projectile and the total time in the air (time of flight) is determined by the initial vertical velocity and the acceleration due to gravity. The horizontal distance travelled (range) is determined by the initial horizontal velocity and the time of flight.

Start by understanding these basics, and remember to break down each problem into vertical and horizontal components. Would you like some practice problems or more resources on this topic?

2. "Swiss Quantum Days 2024, Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland": At this conference, attendees likely shared the latest research in quantum science, explored potential applications, and discussed the challenges and opportunities in the field.

3. "Molecular Quantum Science and Technology Conference, Vienna, Austria": This event was about intermixing quantum physics and molecular science. How can quantum states inform us about molecular behavior? What methods use quantum physics to improve our capability for discovering new molecules?

4. "Frontiers of Quantum Mechanics Physics Winter School, Bad Honnef, Germany": This conference provides a platform for attendees to learn about recent advancements, engage in scholarly discussions about quantum mechanics, and potentially work on problems or exercises in a workshop setting.

5. "Quantum Science Conference GRC": The main agenda in this conference was likely to address our understanding of many-body quantum systems and how that understanding can be applied to improve quantum computing, sensing, simulation and emerging platforms.

6. "Mechanical Systems in the Quantum Regime Conference GRC": The focus here is the intersection of quantum physics with classical mechanics. This can cover topics such as how the quantum properties of materials can be used to engineer new mechanical systems.

7. "Q-MAT 2024, IIT Guwahati India": The key focus likely lies in Quantum Condensed Matter. Discussions might revolve around behaviors of matter that only occur at extreme scales, revealing properties that defy classical physics.

8. "IARD 2024 Conference": This conference aimed to explore the deeper theoretical aspects of quantum physics, as well as the real-world applications of these theories, refining our understanding of everything from the fundamental nature of the universe to the development of future technologies.

I hope these expanded details could provide a better glimpse into what these conferences might be about.
